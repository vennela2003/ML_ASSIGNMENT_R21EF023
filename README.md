# Machine Learning Assignment - 1

This repository contains the solution to "Machine Learning Assignment - 1," which involves data preprocessing, data analysis, and the application of machine learning algorithms to a dataset. The primary objectives are:

1. Download a dataset from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle, data.world, data.gov.in).
2. Apply at least 10 preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data using Python programming.
3. Utilize Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, Plotly, etc., to create a minimum of 10 data visualizations.
4. Apply five different machine learning algorithms to the dataset and compare their accuracy ratios.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this assignment has been obtained from GITHUB, and it can be found in the https://github.com/krishnaik06/Multiple-Linear-Regression/blob/master/50_Startups.csv  directory. Please refer to the dataset's documentation for details on its structure and attributes.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps applied to the dataset include, but are not limited to:
- Data cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Data transformation
- Data normalization
- Data Visualization
- Data Splitting

## Data Analysis
The data analysis section involves the creation of various data visualizations using Python libraries. The generated charts provide insights and inferences from the dataset.

### Examples of Data Visualizations
-  Profit Distribution
- R&D Spend vs. Profit
- Pairplot for all numerical variables
- Correlation Heatmap
-  Pairplot with Hue by Marketing Spend Range
-  Boxplot of Profit by Company Region

## Machine Learning Algorithms
Five different machine learning algorithms have been applied to the preprocessed dataset to make predictions or classifications. The algorithms used include, but are not limited to:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks

## Comparing Accuracy
The accuracy of each machine learning model has been measured, and a comparison of the results is provided.
